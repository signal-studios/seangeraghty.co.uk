		<p>In August 2015 Piers from (what was) Fans Choir approached me to redesign their iPhone app and brand. In one of our first meetings I asked Piers to explain his ambitions for Fans Choir and we brainstormed on ways to improve what they already had with a fresh design and new approach to both the design and code of the app itself. Fans Choir was undergoing a massive overhaul and so was the name, Fans Choir was to be replaced by Fans Voice, following a discussion Piers and I had on the ambitions for the app and making the name more descriptive to the product itself.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="full-width second"></div>
	<div class="writing">
		<p>The first things to tackle was the transition from Fans Choir to Fans Voice and what that would mean for the brand. Piers had spoken to me about wanting to eventually expand the original app idea beyond football and as the first app name was decided based on it’s abbreviation (FC) rather than trying to explain what the app was about. Instead I suggested we try something more inclusive, and as the app is designed for allowing fans to commuicate their feelings about their team, so we decide on Fans Voice.</p>
		<p>Whilst rebranding the app to Fans Voice, I advised that we should think about how the new logo could be used across a universal range of sports. In order facilitate this movement a decision was made to shift the logo from it’s current text based form to an image that could encompass all sports. After some exploration we decided to settle on a simple badge esque format that could represent anything from a football team to a hockey team or even a basketball team.</p>

		<p>As Fans Voice was a complete rework on both a branding and a code front (with Piers and his partners working on the code side) we had to decide on which parts of the app were vital to include and would form part of our first product release. The fundamental underlying of the original app was socially sharing what you thought about your team, post and pre match, and we thought that most people talk about their teams line-up so we would focus on that aspect of the application first.</p>

		<p>When changing players in the old Fans Choir app a tap was all that was required, however through a round of user testing and looking into the basic functionalities of the app, we decided that it was probably best to change this tap to a tap and hold. This when accompanied by a vibration would give the user more feedback as to whether they had selected a player to be changed or not. The screen above showcases the change player screen (in this instance with Manchester United as the chosen team).</p>

		<p>Designing the app for Fans Voice was great fun, not only was I able to have an overseers influence over how a product took shape, but I also got to work on an app that featured my favourite sport, football. However the app and branding weren’t the only two bits of the project I worked on, I also made all 20 Premier League 15/16 home kits to put inside the app improving on the basic colour based examples that existed in the previous app (Fans Choir).</p>
