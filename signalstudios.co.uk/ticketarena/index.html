<h1>Ticket Arena approached me to design them a mobile app.</h1>

<h2>Ticket Arena are a company based in the UK, selling tickets to festivals and events both here in the UK and across Europe. I was first approached in August of 2014 to design them a ticketing app, where a user could log on and purchase tickets for various events.</h2>

<h2>The above screen showcases the home feed design for the application. The large imagery makes it easy for customers to see exactly who is performing whilst the information on where and when is located within the same section ensuring that there is no confusion when quickly browsing through the app. The QR feature on the bottom, links to a new screen in which a user can scan a code on a poster to jump straight to that event.</h2>

<h2>Search was always going to be an important part to this app. Therefore I had to think hard about nailing this section of the app.</h2>

<h2>One of the problems I generally face when searching in an app is the rubbish auto-completion, it either starts too early or doesn&rsquo;t give me the right results. Therefore I decided, that for instance, if someone was to search for &ldquo;Basement Ja&rdquo;, they would get results for Basement Jaxx, and all of their appropriate dates, meaning that you wouldn&rsquo;t be searching around looking for that one venue near you. Similarly, this would work with Venues, but instead of listing the venue in the search results it would list the upcoming events at the venue you searched for.</h2>

<h2>Overall I really loved working on this project in colaboration with the team over at TicketArena.</h2>

<h2>However we both had to move our separate ways, due to Ticket Arena deciding to take their design team in house, and well I was still at university at that point.</h2>
