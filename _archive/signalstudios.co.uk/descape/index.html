<h1>Descape is a tool designed to allow you to just get on with your work.</h1>

<h2>Descape is a website that looks at providing you with somewhere to really escape to whilst trying to complete a project or maybe you want a working company retreat somewhere in the mountains, Descape is there to facilitate that need and work to provide you the best place to get your head down and then get some rest when you most need it.</h2>

<h2>Over the course of last summer I interned at Intelligent Penguin, a design studio in Saffron Walden. I managed to progress skills in web design and brand development working on a grand total of 20 projects in a very short period of time. One of these projects was Descape.</h2>

<h2>Descape is a project from one of the founders, and focuses on the hot desk market. The initial idea was you visited a website, found somewhere to get to work and hired the space for a few days. This then progressed into the idea for Descape, an app that allows the public to host adverts for a desk or space in their house, holiday home or anywhere really that someone could go and work. This space would not only include a desk but also somewhere to sleep, it could be anything from a whole cabin in woodland, through to a room in a manor house in the country, or even a whole hose. The room bit was important, it allowed Descape to have something else that no other company has and that would (we hoped) prove to be the selling point to potential customers.</h2>

<h2>Descape provided me with a chance to also experiment with my illustration skills. As part of the branding I wanted to include some flat illustrations that would not only help bring more colour to the website but they would also act as a lead to potential places where future customers could visit.</h2>
