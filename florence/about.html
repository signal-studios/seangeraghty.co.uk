    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>We are a young and growing team of 33, founded in 2016 and led by a former doctor-turned-entrepreneur.</p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p class="bold">We have a bold vision - to fill every care vacancy in less than sixty seconds.  We want to empower care homes and staff to connect seamlessly.  We believe in choice.</p>
      <p>Our co-founder and CEO, Dr Charles Armitage, experienced on the frontline of the NHS that the way we work needed to change.  Time and again he saw care providers and workers slaves to opaque and inefficient practices that were bleeding precious resources from the sector - resources that should be going into providing people with the care that they deserve.</p>
      <p>After working a number of 'agency' shifts, constantly exposed to unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people, Charles realised what had to happen.  He gathered a group of passionate, caring and intelligent colleagues and together they built Florence.</p>
      <p>Today, Florence is the marketplace for nurses and carers to find shifts in the care sector.  We are shining a light on flexible staffing, building our movement on the guiding principles of quality, choice and transparency.  We are a team of people brought together by one purpose: to provide everyone with the care and dignity that they deserve.</p>
